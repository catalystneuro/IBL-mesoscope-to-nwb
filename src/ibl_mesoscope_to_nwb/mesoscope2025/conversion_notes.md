### Raw imaging
ScanImage multi-plane single channel acquisition
In the Example session shared (cotexlab) --> 8 planes that may differ either in XY location and in depth.
--> Discussed with Miles that these plane acquisition would be stored as indvidual TwoPhotonSeries, e.g TwoPhotonSeriesFOV_00, TwoPhotonSeriesFOV_01, TwoPhotonSeriesFOV_02, etc...
